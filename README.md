Wireless Fencing System (weapons, not posts and pickets)

WirelessFencingClient is code and configuration on a raspberry pi device interfacing with standard fencing gear (swords, cables, etc.) running python. It connects to and communicates time sync, hit, and grounding data with a scorebox server over bluetooth.

WirelessFencingSandbox is the prototype of a wireless fencing scorebox app. It requests and establishes connections to player devices as well, configures match details, and processes client data as it comes in.
