Wireless Fencing System (weapons, not posts and pickets)

WirelessFencingSandbox is the prototype of a wireless fencing scoring system. It utilizes raspberry pi client devices interfacing with standard fencing gear (swords, cables, etc.) running python. The clients connect to and communicate time sync, hit, and grounding data with a scorebox server over bluetooth.
